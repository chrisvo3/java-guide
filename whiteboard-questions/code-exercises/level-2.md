> FUNDAMENTALS

This time no story, no theory. The examples below show you how to write function `accum`:

__Example__ :

```java
accum("abcd") -> "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"
accum("RqaEzty") -> "R-Qq-Aaa-Eeee-Zzzzz-Tttttt-Yyyyyyy"
accum("cwAt") -> "C-Ww-Aaa-Tttt"
```

The parameter of accum is a string which includes only letters from a..z and A..Z.

```java
public class Accumul {
    public static String accum(String s) {
    		// your code
    }
}
```

#### The Solution
