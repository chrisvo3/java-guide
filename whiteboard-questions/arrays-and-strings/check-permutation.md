# Check Permutation

Give two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the otehr

## Hint

Describe what it means for two strings to be permutations of each other. Now, look at that definition you provided. Can you check the strings against taht definition?

There is one solution that is `O(n log n)` time. Another solution uses some space, but is `O(n)` time.

Could a has table be useful?

Two strings that are permutations should have the same chracters, but in different orders. Can you make the orders the same?
