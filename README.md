# Study Java

* __Purpose__ : These are my notes to study. Usually this is private repo, but sometime I open this in order to share my notes with friends.

## About

> Please notice that I don't claim to own any of these infomation.

This repository is mainly for myself to study in Java. Maybe this would help other people to study as well.

> Please notice that not everything vocabulary terms will be on here.

In the future, I might have a website that go over everything about Java, include its definition.

## Index

> Most interviewrs won't ask about specific algorithms for binary tree balancing or other complex algorithms. Frankly, being several years out of school, they probably don't remember these algorithms either.
>
> You're usually only expect to know the basic.

These are must-have knowledge.

*This table is build using [Table Geneartors Tool](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)*

| Data Structure        | Algorithms          | Concepts                |
|-----------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Linked Lists          | Breath-First Search | Bit Manipulation        |
| Trees, Tries & Graphs | Depth-First Search  | Memory (Stack vs. Heap) |
| Stacks & Queues       | Binary Search       | Recursion               |
| Heaps                 | Merge Sort          | Dynamic Progamming      |
| Vectors / ArrayLists  | Quick Sort          | Big O Time & Space      |
| Hash Tables           |                     |                         |

Make sure that you understand how to use and implement them, and where applicable, the space and time complexity. Practicing implementing the data structures and algorithm is a great exercise.
