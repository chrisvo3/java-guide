# Study Java

* __Purpose__ : These are my notes to study. Usually this is private repo, but sometime I open this in order to share my notes with friends.

## About

> Please notice that I don't claim to own any of these infomation.

This repository is mainly for myself to study in Java. Maybe this would help other people to study as well.

> Please notice that not everything vocabulary terms will be on here.

In the future, I might have a website that go over everything about Java, include its definition.

__Algorithm__ : These go over the everything you need to know about algorithm for the interview, include sample code for Java.

__Live Interview__ : Some real interviews that I and other people went through. These is viewed as a review and a guide.

__Logical__: A mini game that help sharping mind and refresh mind before doing some coding.

__Vocabulary__ : Most of these terms are coming from the book `Java Interview Guide` by `Anthony Depalma`. While some of them are from a lot of googling with my own definition.

__Whiteboard__ : These questions with their level are coming from `CodeWar` and `HackerRank`.
