# Study Java

* __Purpose__ : To review and practice material before interview

## About

> Please notice that I don't claim to own any of these infomation.

This repository is mainly for myself to study and prepare for interviews in Java. Maybe this would help other people to study as well.

> Please notice that not everything vocabulary terms will be on here.

In the future, I might have a website that go over everything about Java, include its definition.

__Algorithm__ : These go over the everything you need to know about algorithm for the interview, include sample code for Java.

__Live Interview__ : Some real interviews that I and other people went through. These is viewed as a review and a guide.

__Logical__: A mini game that help sharping mind and refresh mind before doing some coding.

__Vocabulary__ : Most of these terms are coming from the book `Java Interview Guide` by `Anthony Depalma`. While some of them are from a lot of googling with my own definition.

__Whiteboard__ : These questions with their level are coming from `CodeWar` and `HackerRank`.
