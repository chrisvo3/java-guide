## Answers

### Question 1. What color is the vice president's car?
The vice president' car cannot be `red`, because that is the CEO's car, which is in the first space. Nor can it be `purple`, because that is the treasurer's car, which is in the last space. Nor `yellow`, because that is the secretary's.

The president's car must be `blue`, because it is parked between a `red` car (in the first space) and a `green` car, which must be the vice president's.

### Question 2. Who is the CEO?
The CEO drives a `red` car and parks in the first space. `Enid` drives a `green` car, `Bert`'s car is not in the first space; `David`'s is not in the first space, but the last. `Alice`'s car is parked next to `David`'s, so `Cheryl` is the CEO. 

### Question 3. Who is the secretary?
`Cheryl` cannot be the secretary, since she's the CEO, nor can `Enid`, because she drives a `green` car, and the secretary drives a `yellow` car. `David`'s, the `purple` car, is in the last space. `Alice` is the secretary, because her car is parked next to `David`'s, which is where the secretary's car is parked.

### Question 4. Which city got the most rain?
`Olliopolis` got `44 inches` of rain. `Last Stand` got more rain than that, so it got `65 inches`, which is the most.

### Question 5. How much rain did Mile City get?
`Olliopolis` got `44 inches` of rain, `Last Stand` got `65`, and `Polberg` got `12`. `New Town` is in `the mountains`, and `the city` in `the mountains` got `32 inches` of rain. Therefore, `Mile City` got `27 inches`. 

### Question 6. Which city is in the desert?
The city that got the least rain is in `the desert`. `New Town` is in `the mountains`. `Last Stand` got more rain than `Olliopolis`, so it cannot be the city with the least rain; also, `Mile City` cannot be the city with the least rain. `Olliopolis` got `44 inches` of rain. Therefore, `Polberg` is in `the desert` and got `12 inches` of rain.

### Question 7. Where is Olliopolis located?
`Olliopolis` got `44 inches` of rain, so it is not in `the desert` or `the forest`. The city in `the mountains` got `32 inches` of rain; `the coast` got `27 inches`. Therefore, `Olliopolis` is in `a valley`.

### Question 8. What task does Terry do on Wednesday?
`Terry` does not `dust`, `mop`, or do `laundry` or `vacuum`. Therefore, `Terry` does the `sweeping` on `Wednesday`.

### Question 9. What day does Uma do her task?
`Uma` does the `mopping`, which is done on `Thursday`.

### Question 10. What day is the vacuuming done?
`Dusting` is on `Tueday`, `sweeping` is on `Wednesday`, `mopping` is on `Thursday`, and `laundry` is on `Friday`. Therefore, the `vacuuming` is done on `Monday`.
