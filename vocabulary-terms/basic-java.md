# About Java

## What is Java

Java is an object-oriented programming language that allowed developers to write code that could run on multiple platforms.

## Java Principle

WORA = Write Once, Run Anywhere
prevented the need for developers to write different applications for different operating system.

## Java Syntax

Java borrowed much of its syntax from C++, but it streamlined development by providing features such as automatic memory management and by eliminating pitfalls such as multiple inheritance

## Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

A virtual machine is software that emulates physical machine. In Java, code is complied into virtual machine language called `bytecode`.

The JVM acts as intermediary between `bytecode` and te underlying physical machine.

## Java Runtime Environment (JRE)

## Java Development Kit (JDK)

## Procedural Programming

> is a style of writing code that executes a series of linear procedures to produce a result. 

Procedural code is easier to use in small projects or in multithreaded environments due to its stateless nature.

## Object-Oriented Programming

> is a style of writing code that used objects to encapsulate state and behavior.

Object-oriented programming is far more flexible and easier to maintain.
